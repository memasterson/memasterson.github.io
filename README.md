# Massively Starter (GitHub Pages)

This is a minimal starter wired for the **Massively** theme from HTML5 UP.

## How to use

1. Create a new public repo named **`memasterson.github.io`**.
2. Upload **all files** from this ZIP to the repo root.
3. **Add the Massively assets**:
   - Download the theme ZIP from https://html5up.net/massively
   - Copy the **`assets/`** folder from the ZIP into your repo (replace this placeholder `assets/` folder).
   - Optionally copy any sample images into `/images` and update links.
4. Visit `https://memasterson.github.io` (Pages serves from the root automatically).

## Editing content

- **Home:** `index.html` — hero and feature cards.
- **Research:** `research.html` — cards for projects.
- **Publications:** `publications.html` — loads items from `data/pubs.json` (client-side filter by search/year/tag).
- **Talks:** `talks.html` — loads items from `data/talks.json`.
- **Teaching/Outreach/CV:** edit respective HTML files. Put your PDF at `/cv/Masterson_CV.pdf` and update the link if needed.
